# Websky Intern's Capstone Project

## Background
There are users who own a Wear OS or Android devices that have an iPhone.
Currently, there is no platform outside of the Android watch play store that allows these users to browse and download applications
directly to their device. This web platform will eventually be a feature on the existing Google play webstore, making the app store
more accessible and user friendly.

## Objective
Our objective is to create a platform on the Google Play webstore for Wear OS users to easily access and download applications for their devices.

## Design Details
Our design details and timeline are covered further in the design doc.
